# It was proposed to add 'bury' as an analogue/opposite to 'dig' (https://bugs.ruby-lang.org/issues/11747#note-7)
#
# This is similar to: That's what they used here: https://lodash.com/docs/#set
#
# Should we add Enumerable#bury, too? Or can it even be made that general purpose. See discussion in
# issue.
